minishell1 for Epitech by VPARRES
=================================
Description
-----------
This is my first self coded shell, based on tcsh's behaviour. This project is the first part of a bigger projetc, the 42sh, a self coded clone of tcsh.

The minishell1 not a fully complete shell (especially on environnement variables system).

Remember, if you're an Epitech student, you can watch this code to help you, but be careful, the -42 mark comes faster than you think.
